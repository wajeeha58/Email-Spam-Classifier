# Email-Spam-Classifier

# Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Collected and cleaned a dataset of emails.
Handled missing values and labeled emails as spam or ham.

# Feature Engineering:

Applied TF-IDF vectorization to convert text data into numerical features for model input.

# Model Development:

Developed and trained a logistic regression model for spam classification.
Fine-tuned model parameters to enhance performance.

# Model Evaluation:

Evaluated model performance using accuracy metrics on both training and test datasets.
Achieved high accuracy in distinguishing between spam and ham emails.

# Predicting New Data:

Implemented the model to classify new, unseen emails in real-time.

# Deployment:

Integrated the model into a production environment to handle real-time email classification.
Set up an interface or API for seamless interaction with the model
.
Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TF-IDF Vectorization, Logistic Regression.
